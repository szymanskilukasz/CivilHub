CivilHub
----------
CivilHub is a free and open-source platform written in Python & Django for the purpose of collaboration in  local civic communities. 

Our biggest dream is to build a tool that helps us to collaborate and communicate in places we live in. In our opinion, citizens need a platform that will help them transform democracy and civil power onto a next level. 

We believe that together we can create amazing things in our cities.

Our Mission
----------
CivilHub’s mission is to engage all citizens in improving the countries, cities and all places they live in.

Features
----------
1. **Places** - each country, town, district and housing can have their own place that allows people to collaborate.
2. **Ideas** - users can propose what should be improved in our environment, law, and community.
  - Everyone can vote for ideas. Vote Yes or No, 
  - Anyone can check who vote Yes and who No,

5. **Polls** - users can create polls for people in Places. All answers and statistics are public
6. **Projects** - one of most the most important part of our platform. I bielieve that Ideas on their own can't change the World. We have created a tool that allows to transform ideas into local civil projects. Users can create and divade tasks, to bring the project to alive.  All of this was made in order to implement our ideas into life.
7. **Map** - all content types can be marked on a map. You can see all the initiatives, discussions, projects and locations in a fully interactive map. Due to limitations in Google Maps (not a good solution for Clustering and displaying more than 100 thousand points on a map). We had to write our own solutions.
  - We used the Open Street Map - Taile are currently downloaded from Mapbox, in the future we will possibly implement our own server with map tails,
  - PostGIS for PostgreSQL database,
  - Our overlay clustering, server-side filtering displays only those points that you currently see on the screen.
